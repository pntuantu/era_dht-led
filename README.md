The ERa IoT project utilizes an ESP32 to connect with a DHT22 sensor and an LED. 
Data collected from the DHT22 is sent to the ERa platform via virtual pins. 
The LED is controlled through virtual pins and actions, with data logged on the ERa platform.
This code can be compiled by ARDUINO IDE platform.
